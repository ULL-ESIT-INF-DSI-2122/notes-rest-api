# Example of Express application

This repository contains a project that illustrates the creation of a simple Express application
that performs CRUD operations over a MongoDB database. The application is written in TypeScript.

It also illustrates how we can test our Express application through Mocha, Chai and Supertest,
as well as we can perform code coverage through Instanbul and Coveralls, and Continuous Integration
by means of GitHub Actions.
